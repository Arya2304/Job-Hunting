# Job-Hunting


Problem Statement: Finding relevant job openings and applying for them can be a time-consuming and repetitive process.

Proposed Solution: We have developed a GUI that simplifies job hunting by automating tasks of searching for jobs .

This project uses a dummy website: https://arya2304.github.io/job-site/ to scrape the job data.

Project Highlights: The application allow users to enter a URL, potentially from a job board website. It then retrieves job postings and displays them in a table format, details like title, company, and location. This could significantly reduce the time spent searching for jobs.

Technologies Used: Python libraries-pandas,BeautifulSoup,bs4,requests,tkinter.

Skills: Python (Programming Language) 路 Beautiful Soup 路 Computerized System Validation (CSV) 路 request 路 Data Analysis
